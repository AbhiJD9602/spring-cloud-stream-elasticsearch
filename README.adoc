== Goal

The goal of this project is to implement a `News` processing pipeline composed of 5 microservices: producer-api,
categorizer-service, collector-service, publisher-api and news-client.

* We are using https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-stream/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle[Spring Cloud Stream]
framework for building highly scalable event-driven microservices connected with shared messaging systems.

* We are using https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/elasticsearch/docs/current/reference/html/[Spring Data Elasticsearch]
to persist data in https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch[Elasticsearch].

* We are using https://www.thymeleaf.org/[Thymeleaf] as HTML template

* We are using https://zipkin.io[Zipkin] for visualizing traces between and within microservices.

* We are using https://github.com/Netflix/eureka/wiki[Eureka], also known as Discovery Server, it is an application that holds the information about all
microservices.

== Microservices

=== producer-api
Spring-boot application that creates news and pushes news events to a kafka topic `producer.news`.

=== categorizer-service
Spring-boot application that listens for news events in kafka topic `producer.news`, categorizes and pushes them to the
topic `categorizer.news`.

=== collector-service
Spring-boot application that listens for news events in topic `categorizer.news`, saves them in Elasticsearch and pushes
the news events to kafka topic `collector.news`.

=== publisher-api
Spring-boot application that reads directly from Elasticsearch and exposes a REST. It doesn't listen from kafka.

=== news-client
Spring-boot application that provides a News user interface. It implements a *Websocket* that consumes news events from
the topic `collector.news`. So, news are updated on the fly on the main page. Besides, `news-client` communicates directly
with `publisher-api` whenever search for a specific news or news update are needed.

The Websocket operation is shown in the short gif bellow. An news is created in `producer-api` and, immediately, it is
shown in `news-client`

== Start Environment

=== Docker Compose

- Open one terminal

- In `/spring-cloud-stream-elasticsearch` root folder run
```
docker-compose up -d
```
[NOTE]
====
To stop and remove containers, networks, images, and volumes
```
docker-compose down -v
```
====

- Wait a little bit until all containers are Up (healthy). You can check their status running
```
docker-compose ps
```

- In `/spring-cloud-stream-elasticsearch/scripts` and run the following script
```
./create-index.sh
```
It will create an index `news_v1` (with alias `news`) in Elasticsearch.

* Check _news_v1_ index mapping
```
curl http://localhost:9200/news_v1/_mapping
```

* Check existing ES alias
```
curl http://localhost:9200/_aliases
```

=== Generate NewsEvent

Inside `/spring-cloud-stream-elasticsearch/commons` folder run
```
mvn clean install
```
It will install `commons-news-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar` in you local Maven repository, so that it can be visible by all services.

== Start Services

=== eureka-server

- Open a new terminal
- Inside `/spring-cloud-stream-elasticsearch/eureka-server` folder run
```
mvn spring-boot:run
```
- The link for `eureka-server` is http://localhost:8761

=== producer-api

- Open a new terminal
- Inside `/spring-cloud-stream-elasticsearch/producer-api` folder run
```
mvn spring-boot:run
```
- The link for `producer-api` swagger is http://localhost:8081/swagger-ui.html

=== categorizer-service

- Open a new terminal
- Inside `/spring-cloud-stream-elasticsearch/categorizer-service` folder run
```
mvn spring-boot:run
```

=== collector-service

- Open a new terminal
- Inside `/spring-cloud-stream-elasticsearch/collector-service` folder run
```
mvn spring-boot:run
```

=== publisher-api

- Open a new terminal
- Inside `/spring-cloud-stream-elasticsearch/publisher-api` folder run
```
mvn spring-boot:run
```
- The link for `publisher-api` swagger is http://localhost:8084/swagger-ui.html

=== news-client

- Open a new terminal
- Inside `/spring-cloud-stream-elasticsearch/news-client` folder run
```
mvn spring-boot:run
```
- The link for `news-client` website is http://localhost:8085

== Useful links

=== Zipkin

- Zipkin can be accessed at http://localhost:9411

- In figure bellow is shown an example of all flow that a news passes, since `producer-api`, where it is created, until
`news-client` where it is consumed.

== TODO

- news-client: bug. everytime sync is clicked, it enables websocket;
- news-client: if websocket is enabled/disabled, sync button should be disabled/enabled;
- news-client: implement pagination;
